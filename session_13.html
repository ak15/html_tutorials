<!-- Before tackling page layout, however, it is important to understand four
particular CSS properties individually before putting them all together:
. The margin and padding properties—For adding space around ele-
ments
. The align and float properties—Used to place your elements in
relation to others

Using Margins
Style sheet margins enable you to add empty space around the outside of the
rectangular area for an element on a web page. It is important to remember
that the margin property works with space outside of the element.
Following are the style properties for setting margins:
. margin-top —Sets the top margin
. margin-right —Sets the right margin
. margin-bottom —Sets the bottom margin
. margin-left —Sets the left margin
. margin —Sets the top, right, bottom, and left margins as a single
property
We want the margin around each <div> to be 15 pixels on all sides,
so we can use the following:
margin-top:15px;
margin-right:15px;
margin-bottom:15px;
margin-left:15px;
You could also write that in shorthand, using the margin property:
margin:15px 15px 15px 15px;

Padding Elements
Padding is similar to margins in that it adds extra space to elements, but the
big difference is where that space is located. If you recall, margins are added
to the outside of elements. On the other hand, padding adds space inside the
rectangular area of an element. As an example, if you create a style rule for
an element that establishes a width of 50 pixels and a height of 30 pixels,
and then sets the padding of the rule to 5 pixels, the remaining content area
will be 40 pixels by 20 pixels. Also, because the padding of an element
appears within the element’s content area, it will assume the same style as
the content of the element, including the background color.


You specify the padding of a style rule using one of the padding properties,
which work very much like the margin properties. The following padding
properties are available for use in setting the padding of style rules:
. padding-top —Sets the top padding
. padding-right —Sets the right padding
. padding-bottom —Sets the bottom padding
. padding-left —Sets the left padding
. padding —Sets the top, right, bottom, and left padding as a single
property
As with margins, you can set the padding of style rules using individual
padding properties or the single padding property. Padding can also be
expressed using either a unit of measurement or a percentage.
Following is an example of how you might set the left and right padding
for a style rule so that there are 10 pixels of padding on each side of an ele-
ment’s content:
padding-left:10px;
padding-right:10px;
As with margins, you can set all the padding for an element with a single
property (the padding property). To set the padding property, you can use
the same three approaches available for the margin property. Following is
an example of how you would set the vertical padding (top/bottom) to 12
pixels and the horizontal padding (left/right) to 8 pixels for a style rule:
padding:12px 8px;
Following is more explicit code that performs the same task by specifying
all the padding values:
padding:12px 8px 12px 8px;

. Just remember: margins outside the element, padding inside it.

Keeping Everything Aligned

Keeping Everything Aligned
Knowing that content on a web page doesn’t always fill the entire width of
the rectangular area in which it is displayed, it is often helpful to control
the alignment of the content. Even if text within a rectangular area extends
to multiple lines, alignment still enters the picture because you might want
the text left-justified, right-justified, or centered. There are two style prop-
erties that enable you to control the alignment of elements: text-align
and vertical-align .

As a refresher, using text-align aligns an element horizontally within its
bounding area, and it can be set to left , right , center , or justify .


The vertical-align property is similar to text-align except that it is
used to align elements vertically. The vertical-align property specifies
how an element is aligned with its parent, or in some cases, the current
line of elements on the page. Current line refers to the vertical placement
of elements that appear within the same parent element—in other words,

inline elements. If several inline elements appear on the same line, you can
set their vertical alignments the same to align them vertically. A good
example would be a row of images that appear one after the next—the
vertical-align property enables you to align them vertically.

Following are common values for use with the vertical-align property:
. top —Aligns the top of an element with the current line
. middle —Aligns the middle of an element with the middle of its parent
. bottom —Aligns the bottom of an element with the current line
. text-top —Aligns the top of an element with the top of its parent
. baseline —Aligns the baseline of an element with the baseline of its
parent
. text-bottom —Aligns

Understanding the Float Property

Understanding the float property is fundamental to understanding CSS-
based layout and design; it is one of the last pieces in the puzzle of how all
these elements fit together.

Elements float horizontally, not vertically, so all you have to concern yourself
with are two possible values: right and left . When used, an element that
floats will float as far right or as far left (depending on the value of float ) as
the containing element will allow it. For example, if you have three <div> s
float values of left, they will all line up to the left of the containing body ele-
ment. If you have your <div> s within another <div> , they will line up to the
left of that element, even if that element itself is floated to the right.
