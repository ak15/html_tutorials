<!--
The cascading part of the name CSS refers to the manner in which style
sheet rules are applied to elements in an HTML document. More specifical-
ly, styles in a CSS style sheet form a hierarchy in which more specific styles
override more general styles. It is the responsibility of CSS to determine
the precedence of style rules according to this hierarchy, which establishes
a cascading effect. If that sounds a bit confusing, just think of the cascading
mechanism in CSS as being similar to genetic inheritance, in which general
traits are passed from parents to a child, but more specific traits are entire-
ly unique to the child. Base style rules are applied throughout a style sheet
but can be overridden by more specific style rules.-->
