There are actually four different places where you might use scripts:
. In the body of the page—In this case, the script’s output is displayed
as part of the HTML document when the browser loads the page.
. In the header of the page between the <head> tags—Scripts in the
header can’t create output within the HTML document, but can be
referred to by other scripts. The header is often used for functions—
groups of JavaScript statements that can be used as a single unit. You
will learn more about functions in Chapter 14, “Getting Started with
JavaScript Programming.”
. Within an HTML tag, such as <body> or <form> —This is called an
event handler and enables the script to work with HTML elements.
When using JavaScript in event handlers, you don’t need to use the
<script> tag. You’ll learn more about event handlers in Chapter 14.
. In a separate file entirely—JavaScript supports the use of files with
the .js extension containing scripts; these can be included by specify-
ing a file in the <script> tag.


. In Firefox, you can also select Tools, JavaScript Console from the
menu. The console is shown in Figure 4.4, displaying the error mes-
sage you created in this example.
. In Chrome, select Tools, JavaScript Console from the Customizations
(Options) menu. A console will display in the bottom of the browser
window.
. In Internet Explorer, select Tools, Internet Options. On the Advanced
page, uncheck the Disable Script Debugging box and check the
Display a Notification About Every Script Error box. (If this is dis-
abled, a yellow icon in the status bar will still notify you of errors.)
