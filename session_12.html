These are but a few of the issues in table-based web design. For a closer

Layout Is Stupid” at http://www.hotdesign.com/seybold/everything.html.

For example, the common pseudoclasses for the <a> tag are link, visited,
hover, and active. You can remember them with the mnemonic “Love-
Hate”—LV (love) HA (hate), if you choose.
. a:link describes the style of a hyperlink that has not been visited
previously.
. a:visited describes the style of a hyperlink that has been visited
previously and is present in the browser’s memory.
. a:hover describes the style of a hyperlink as a user’s mouse hovers
over it (and before it has been clicked).
. a:active describes the style of a hyperlink that is in the act of being
clicked, but has not yet been released.
