      CSS overview

    <div>
      <p>
        CSS includes various style properties that are used to control fonts, colors,
        alignment, and margins, to name just a few. The style properties in CSS can
        be generally grouped into two major categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Layout properties Consist of properties that affect the positioning of elements on a web page, such as margins, padding, alignment, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Formatting properties Consist of properties that affect the visual
          display of elements within a website, such as the font type, size,
          color, and so on
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>
        Layout Properties
      </h1>
      <p>
        CSS layout properties are used to determine how content is placed on a
        web page. One of the most important layout properties is the display
        property, which describes how an element is displayed with respect to
        other elements. There are four possible values for the display property
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          block - The element is displayed on a new line, as in a new paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          list-item - The element is displayed on a new line with a list-item
          mark (bullet) next to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          inline - The element is displayed inline with the current paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          none - The element is not displayed; it is hidden.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The display property relies on a concept known as relative positioning, which means that elements are positioned relative to the location of other elements on a page. CSS also supports absolute positioning, which enables you to place an element at an exact location on a page independent of other elements.

        Formatting Properties
      </h1>
      <div style="border-style:solid;border-width:2px;border-color:blue">
        CSS formatting properties are used to control the appearance of content on a web page, as opposed to controlling the physical positioning of the content. One of the most popular formatting properties is the border property
      </div>
      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        The following border properties provide a means of describing the borders of an element:
        <li>
          border-width - The width of the border edge
        </li>
        <li>
          border-color - The color of the border edge
        </li>
        <li>
          border-style - The style of the border edge
        </li>
        <li>
          border-left - The left side of the border
        </li>
        <li>
          border-right - The right side of the border
        </li>
        <li>
          border-top - The top of the border
        </li>
        <li>
          border-bottom - The bottom of the border
        </li>
        <li>
          border - All the border sides
        </li>

Comments if any
Before showing you a style class, I need to take a quick step back and clarify
some CSS terminology. First off, a CSS style property is a specific style that
can be assigned a value, such as color or font-size . You associate a style
property and its respective value with elements on a web page by using a
selector. A selector is used to identify tags on a page to which you apply
styles. Following is an example of a selector, a property, and a value all
included in a basic style rule:
h1 { font: 36pt Courier; }
In this code, h1 is the selector, font is the style property, and 36pt Courier
is the value. The selector is important because it means that the font setting
will be applied to all h1 elements in the web page. But maybe you want to
differentiate between some of the h1 elementsâ€”what then? The answer lies
in style classes.
Suppose you want two different kinds of <h1> headings for use in your doc-
uments. You would create a style class for each one by putting the following
CSS code in a style sheet:
h1.silly { font: 36pt Comic Sans; }
h1.serious { font: 36pt Arial; }
Classes and ID for style
. - for classes
#- for id
