<!-- Understanding the CSS Box Model and Positioning

css box model = https://www.codeproject.com/KB/HTML/567385/boxmodel-image.png
Here’s yet another explanation of the box model, going from the outside
inward:
. The margin is the area outside of the element. It never has color; it is
always transparent.
. The border extends around the element, on the outer edge of any
padding. The border can be of several types, widths, and colors.
. The padding exists around the content and inherits the background
color of the content area.
. The content is surrounded by padding.

Here’s where the tricky part comes in: To know the true height and width of
an element, you have to take all the elements of the box model into account.
If you remember the example previous when, despite
specifically indicating a <div> should be 250 pixels wide and 100 pixels high,
that <div> had to grow larger to accommodate the padding in use.

The total width of an element is the sum of the following:
width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right +
margin-left + margin-right


The total height of an element is the sum of the following:
height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom +
margin-top + margin-bottom

The Whole Scoop on Positioning

Relative positioning is the default type of positioning used by HTML. You
can think of relative positioning as being akin to laying out checkers on a
checkerboard: The checkers are arranged from left to right, and when you
get to the edge of the board, you move on to the next row. Elements that
are styled with the block value for the display style property are automat-
ically placed on a new row, whereas inline elements are placed on the
same row immediately next to the element preceding them. As an exam-
ple, <p> and <div> tags are considered block elements, whereas the <span>
tag is considered an inline element.

The other type of positioning supported by CSS is known as absolute position-
ing because it enables you to set the exact position of HTML content on a
page. Although absolute positioning gives you the freedom to spell out exact-
ly where an element is to appear, the position is still relative to any parent
elements that appear on the page. In other words, absolute positioning
enables you to specify the exact location of an element’s rectangular area with
respect to its parent’s area, which is very different from relative positioning.
With the freedom of placing elements anywhere you want on a page, you
can run into the problem of overlap, which is when an element takes up
space used by another element. There is nothing stopping you from speci-
fying the absolute locations of elements so they overlap. In this case, CSS
relies on the z-index of each element to determine which element is on the
top and which is on the bottom. You’ll learn more about the z-index of ele-
ments later in the chapter. For now, let’s look at exactly how you control
whether a style rule uses relative or absolute positioning.
The type of positioning (relative or absolute) used by a particular style rule
is determined by the position property, which is capable of having one of
the following two values: relative or absolute . After specifying the type
of positioning, you then provide the specific position using the following
properties:
. left —The left position offset
. right —The right position offset
. top —The top position offset
. bottom —The bottom position offset

<!-- Before tackling page layout, however, it is important to understand four
particular CSS properties individually before putting them all together:
. The margin and padding properties—For adding space around ele-
ments
. The align and float properties—Used to place your elements in
relation to others

Using Margins
Style sheet margins enable you to add empty space around the outside of the
rectangular area for an element on a web page. It is important to remember
that the margin property works with space outside of the element.
Following are the style properties for setting margins:
. margin-top —Sets the top margin
. margin-right —Sets the right margin
. margin-bottom —Sets the bottom margin
. margin-left —Sets the left margin
. margin —Sets the top, right, bottom, and left margins as a single
property
We want the margin around each <div> to be 15 pixels on all sides,
so we can use the following:
margin-top:15px;
margin-right:15px;
margin-bottom:15px;
margin-left:15px;
You could also write that in shorthand, using the margin property:
margin:15px 15px 15px 15px;

Padding Elements
Padding is similar to margins in that it adds extra space to elements, but the
big difference is where that space is located. If you recall, margins are added
to the outside of elements. On the other hand, padding adds space inside the
rectangular area of an element. As an example, if you create a style rule for
an element that establishes a width of 50 pixels and a height of 30 pixels,
and then sets the padding of the rule to 5 pixels, the remaining content area
will be 40 pixels by 20 pixels. Also, because the padding of an element
appears within the element’s content area, it will assume the same style as
the content of the element, including the background color.


You specify the padding of a style rule using one of the padding properties,
which work very much like the margin properties. The following padding
properties are available for use in setting the padding of style rules:
. padding-top —Sets the top padding
. padding-right —Sets the right padding
. padding-bottom —Sets the bottom padding
. padding-left —Sets the left padding
. padding —Sets the top, right, bottom, and left padding as a single
property
As with margins, you can set the padding of style rules using individual
padding properties or the single padding property. Padding can also be
expressed using either a unit of measurement or a percentage.
Following is an example of how you might set the left and right padding
for a style rule so that there are 10 pixels of padding on each side of an ele-
ment’s content:
padding-left:10px;
padding-right:10px;
As with margins, you can set all the padding for an element with a single
property (the padding property). To set the padding property, you can use
the same three approaches available for the margin property. Following is
an example of how you would set the vertical padding (top/bottom) to 12
pixels and the horizontal padding (left/right) to 8 pixels for a style rule:
padding:12px 8px;
Following is more explicit code that performs the same task by specifying
all the padding values:
padding:12px 8px 12px 8px;

. Just remember: margins outside the element, padding inside it.

Keeping Everything Aligned

Keeping Everything Aligned
Knowing that content on a web page doesn’t always fill the entire width of
the rectangular area in which it is displayed, it is often helpful to control
the alignment of the content. Even if text within a rectangular area extends
to multiple lines, alignment still enters the picture because you might want
the text left-justified, right-justified, or centered. There are two style prop-
erties that enable you to control the alignment of elements: text-align
and vertical-align .

As a refresher, using text-align aligns an element horizontally within its
bounding area, and it can be set to left , right , center , or justify .


The vertical-align property is similar to text-align except that it is
used to align elements vertically. The vertical-align property specifies
how an element is aligned with its parent, or in some cases, the current
line of elements on the page. Current line refers to the vertical placement
of elements that appear within the same parent element—in other words,

inline elements. If several inline elements appear on the same line, you can
set their vertical alignments the same to align them vertically. A good
example would be a row of images that appear one after the next—the
vertical-align property enables you to align them vertically.

Following are common values for use with the vertical-align property:
. top —Aligns the top of an element with the current line
. middle —Aligns the middle of an element with the middle of its parent
. bottom —Aligns the bottom of an element with the current line
. text-top —Aligns the top of an element with the top of its parent
. baseline —Aligns the baseline of an element with the baseline of its
parent
. text-bottom —Aligns

Understanding the Float Property

Understanding the float property is fundamental to understanding CSS-
based layout and design; it is one of the last pieces in the puzzle of how all
these elements fit together.

Elements float horizontally, not vertically, so all you have to concern yourself
with are two possible values: right and left . When used, an element that
floats will float as far right or as far left (depending on the value of float ) as
the containing element will allow it. For example, if you have three <div> s
float values of left, they will all line up to the left of the containing body ele-
ment. If you have your <div> s within another <div> , they will line up to the
left of that element, even if that element itself is floated to the right.



Controlling the Way Things Stack Up

There are situations in which you’d like to carefully control the manner in
which elements overlap each other on a web page. The z-index style prop-
erty enables you to set the order of elements with respect to how they
stack on top of each other. Although the name z-index might sound a little
strange, it refers to the notion of a third dimension (Z) that points into the
computer screen, in addition to the two dimensions that go across (X) and
down (Y) the screen. Another way to think of the z-index is the relative
position of a single magazine within a stack of magazines. A magazine
near the top of the stack has a higher z-index than a magazine lower in the
stack. Similarly, an overlapped element with a higher z-index is displayed
on top of an element with a lower z-index.


Managing the Flow of Text

Following are some
style properties that provide you with control over text flow:
. float —Determines how text flows around an element
. clear —Stops the flow of text around an element
. overflow —Controls the overflow of text when an element is too
small to contain all the text
The float property is used to control how text flows around an element. It
can be set to either left or right . These values determine where to posi-
tion an element with respect to flowing text. So, setting an image’s float
property to left positions the image to the left of flowing text.

can be set to either left or right . These values determine where to posi-
tion an element with respect to flowing text. So, setting an image’s float
property to left positions the image to the left of flowing text.

The overflow property handles overflow text, which is text that doesn’t fit
within its rectangular area; this can happen if you set the width and
height of an element too small. The overflow property can be set to
visible , hidden , or scroll . The visible setting automatically enlarges the
element so that the overflow text will fit within it; this is the default setting
